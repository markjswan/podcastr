# Podcastr
Podcastr is a podcast discovery platform. You can use podcastr to search information that has been discussed on podcasts that you have listened to and for discovering new podcasts based on your input data.

## How does it work?
Podcastr is a simple website that allows you to search for podcasts on basic queries. Examples:

- What were the three main topics discussed during the Lex Fridman podcast with Sam Altman?
- Who was Joe Rogan's latest guest? What is the summary of their profile?
- Recommend me three suggestions for podcasts if I like 20VC?
